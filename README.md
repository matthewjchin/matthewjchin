I graduated from the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/) with a BS in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. 

My previous experience includes a data science internship, four years of ITS help desk technician work at the [USF's Information Technology Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/its), and tutoring for the [USF Mathematics and Statistics Department](https://myusf.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/mathematics) for undergraduate students in Pre-Calculus and Calculus I. 

Hope you enjoy and follow along; always willing to learn and collaborate!
