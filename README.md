- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew! 
- 👀 I’m interested in business analytics, data science, and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI and Deep Learning libraries, tools, and statistical packages, as well as [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/), a Google-powered application for BI/programming flowcharting, and [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source projects related to sports, finance, and data visualization.

- My recent project I have been working on in my personal time involves baseball statistics and Sabermetrics, which you can find [here](https://github.com/matthewjchin/baseballstats).

I am currently a first-year graduate student at [Golden Gate University](https://www.ggu.edu/), studying in the Master of Science (MS) in Business Analytics program, having started in September 2021. 
I graduated from the [University of San Francisco (USF)](https://www.usfca.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. 

My previous experience includes a data science internship, a database developer internship helping to create a proof of concept for inventory, four years of help desk technician work at the [USF's Information Technology Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/its), and tutoring for the [USF Mathematics and Statistics Department](https://myusf.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/mathematics) for undergraduate students in Pre-Calculus and Calculus and Analytic Geometry I. 

Hope you enjoy and follow along, always willing to learn and collaborate!
