- My recent project I have been working on in my personal time involves baseball statistics and Sabermetrics, which you can find [here](https://github.com/matthewjchin/baseballstats).



I am currently a first-year graduate student at [Golden Gate University](https://www.ggu.edu/), studying in the Master of Science (MS) in Business Analytics program, having started in September 2021.
I graduated from the [University of San Francisco (USF)](https://www.usfca.edu/) in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. 

My previous experience includes a data science internship, a database developer internship helping to create a proof of concept for inventory, four years of help desk technician work at the [USF's Information Technology Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/its), and tutoring USF undergraduate students in Pre-Calculus and Calculus I. 

Hope you enjoy, always willing to collaborate!
